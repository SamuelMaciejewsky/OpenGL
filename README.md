## Project Overview

This project aims to document the learning process of the OpenGL tool.

- Based on the website: [https://learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com)

## Build System and Environment Setup

This project uses **CMake** as the build system generator. CMake allows you to define your project structure and dependencies in a platform-independent way, generating native build files (such as Makefiles or Visual Studio solutions) for your chosen environment. This makes it easier to manage complex C++ projects and ensures portability.

**Make** is used as the build automation tool. It reads the Makefile generated by CMake and automates the compilation and linking process, handling dependencies and incremental builds efficiently.

For compiling the code, the project relies on the **MSYS2 UCRT** environment, which provides a Unix-like shell and package manager for Windows. MSYS2 UCRT includes the `gcc` and `g++` compilers, making it possible to build C++ projects with modern toolchains on Windows.

### MSYS2 Installation

1. Go to [msys2.org](https://www.msys2.org)
2. Download the installer (e.g., `msys2-x86_64-<version>.exe`)
3. Run the installer and follow the default installation steps

After installation, open the MSYS2 terminal and switch to the UCRT64 environment by running:
You can open the MSYS2 UCRT64 environment in two ways:

1. **Via Windows Start Menu:**
	- Click the Windows Start Menu and search for "MSYS2 UCRT64". Select it to open the correct shell.
2. **Via Command Line:**
	- Open the main MSYS2 terminal and run the following command:

```sh
msys2_shell.cmd -defterm -ucrt64
```

Or select **MSYS2 UCRT64** from the Start Menu.

#### Install GCC (C/C++ Compiler)

In the UCRT64 shell, run:

```sh
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc
```

Set the environment variable `PATH` to include the compiler binaries (default: `C:/msys64/ucrt64/bin`).
Check GCC installation:

```sh
gcc --version
```

#### Install Make

In the UCRT64 shell, run:

```sh
pacman -S make
```

Check Make installation:

```sh
make --version
```
